## 🧑‍💻 Cursor Instructions

When asked to update code:

1. **Always maintain project functionality** — never break build or runtime.
2. **Refactor gradually** if a change touches multiple layers (UI, API, DB).
3. Ensure every component has **SSR-safe** hooks (especially for client-only code).
4. Maintain clean, modular architecture:
   - `src/app` → pages/routes
   - `src/components` → UI components
   - `src/lib` → utilities (auth, db, i18n, store)
   - `src/server` → API and Prisma logic
5. Prioritize:
   - ✅ No runtime errors
   - ✅ No hydration warnings
   - ✅ Clean console
   - ✅ Fully functional features

## 🧠 Design & UX Inspiration

Replicate the layout and user experience of:

- [https://www.aliexpress.com/](https://www.aliexpress.com/)
- [https://www.alibaba.com/](https://www.alibaba.com/)

Use similar:

- Navbar layout (categories, search, account, cart)
- Product grid & detail page design
- Checkout flow
- Vendor dashboard analytics

---

RULE: When improving UI or fixing errors,

- Always use Tailwind colors from tailwind.config.js (primary = #FF5A00, etc.)
- Never use pure yellow backgrounds or text.
- Ensure all motion components run inside "use client" files.
- Add placeholder data or loading skeletons if lists are empty.
- Verify every button and footer link has a valid route.
- All pages must be mobile-responsive and use professional AliExpress-like design.
- Automatically continue fixing issues until project builds and runs without console or runtime errors.

## 🧩 Bonus Enhancements (if time allows)

- AI-based product recommendations using similarity matching.
- Coupon and discount system.
- Review and rating system.
- Delivery tracking (mock API integration).
- Dark mode toggle.

---

## ✅ Final Deliverable

- Runs with: `npm install && npx prisma db push && npm run dev`
- No console warnings.
- Modern, mobile-first design identical in flow to AliExpress.
- English by default; language toggle works globally.
- All buttons, links, and pages functional (no 404s).
- Ready for production deployment to **Vercel** or **Railway**.
